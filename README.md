# RealtimeEdgeDetection

## What is this?
This program uses kernel image processing to detect edges in the webcam.

## What is kernel image processing?
Kernel image processing is applying a small matrix (the kernel) onto an image where the the pixels are represented as a 2D array. A very nice interactive explanation can be found [here](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
## How to use it
This program requires [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) along with the [Video library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html) to run. Once those are installed, simply open RealtimeEdgeDetection in Processing and run it with your camera pointed at something interesting.
